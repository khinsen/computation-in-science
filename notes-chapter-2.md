# Notes for chapter 2: "Computation in science"

## Celestial mechanics

Terence Tao's lecture ["The Cosmic Distance Ladder"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1gfrhNUIg) (1h 37mn) provides much background information about the observation of celestial bodies and the mathematical interpretation of astronomical data.

## Complex computational models

Climate research is an excellent illustration for the tendencies that I outline in chapter 2. Climate models are in fact non-trivial pieces of software. One of them, the [Community Earth System Model](https://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/), is Open Source software, allowing a detailed inspection by anyone.

The November 2015 issue ([@ IEEE](http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/cs/2015/06/index.html), [@ AIP](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/cise/17/6)) of "Computing in Science and Engineering" magazine has "Computing & Climate" as its theme. Several articles explain how traditional physical models are being complemented by generic empirical models that are adapted to observed data using machine learning techniques.

## Algorithmic information theory

Christopher Ford's presented a [nice illustration (video, 42 mn)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3XOfioapI) of Kolmogorov complexity at the Strange Loop 2015 conference, using music as the data being described by algorithms. A [companion site](https://github.com/ctford/kolmogorov-music) contains the programs and further references.
