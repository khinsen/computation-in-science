# Notes for chapter 2: "Computation in science"

## Celestial mechanics

Terence Tao's lecture ["The Cosmic Distance Ladder"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1gfrhNUIg) (1h 37mn) provides much background information about the observation of celestial bodies and the mathematical interpretation of astronomical data.

## Algorithmic information theory

Christopher Ford's presented a [nice illustration (video, 42 mn)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3XOfioapI) of Kolmogorov complexity at the Strange Loop 2015 conference, using music as the data being described by algorithms. A [companion site](https://github.com/ctford/kolmogorov-music) contains the programs and further references.
