# Computation in Science (Second Edition)

This is the companion Web site to the second edition of my book "Computation in Science", which will soon be published by [IOP Publishing](http://ioppublishing.org/). It contains additional notes for each chapter, in particular with references to on-line material that I consider of interest for my readers.

The companion site for the first edition, published in 2015, remains available [here](index-1st.md) for reference.

I will regularly add new references that I discover and remove links that no longer work. Suggestions and corrections are welcome - please [open an issue](https://github.com/khinsen/computation-in-science/issues) (or submit a pull request) on the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/khinsen/computation-in-science).
