# Notes for chapter 6: "Scientific knowledge in the digital age"

## Computerized proofs in mathematics

Mathematicians use computers to generate and verify proofs that are much too long for any human to verify. This raises issues very similar to those resulting from complex computations in science. Can we trust these proofs? What is the status of this kind of knowledge?

A famous example for such a proof of an equally famous theorem is discussed in the article ["Formal proof: The four-color theorem"](http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101382p.pdf). A [more detailed description](http://research.microsoft.com/en-US/people/gonthier/4colproof.pdf) is available from the author's Web site, as is the [source code](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/5464e7b1-bd58-4f7c-bfe1-5d3b32d42e6d/default.aspx) of the proof in the [Coq language](http://coq.inria.fr/).

A few articles on the subject illustrate the debate that is still going on:

 - [Will Computers Redefine the Roots of Math?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150519-will-computers-redefine-the-roots-of-math/)
 - [Computer generated math proof is too large for humans to check](http://phys.org/news/2014-02-math-proof-large-humans.html)  (see also [the original paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2184) about this proof)
 - [In Computers We Trust?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20130222-in-computers-we-trust/)
 - [The future of proof](https://plus.maths.org/content/future-proof)
 - [On proof and progress in mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236)
