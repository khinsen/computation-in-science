# Notes for chapter 1: "What is computation?"

## Arithmetic

Video courses explaining basic arithmetic are provided by the [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic). It is instructive to follow them with an eye on the algorithmic symbol-processing aspect of each technique.

## Computation as an aid for understanding

The [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) project uses games programming for teaching mathematical concepts to students in the 12-16 year age range.

The book [Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-classical-mechanics) teaches classical mechanics using a computational notation. The full text is available ([HTML](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/sicm-html/), [PDF](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0BxVCLS4f8Sg5MDIzMzJmZDQtZGEzMS00NjgxLWE0MjYtMmNlMDA5ZGNmMjg2&hl=en&authkey=CLf8o7YK)), as is [complementary material](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-620j-classical-mechanics-a-computational-approach-fall-2008/) from the corresponding MIT course. The authors have later used the same computational approach for teaching [Functional Differential Geometry](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/functional-differential-geometry), which is also avaiable on-line ([PDF](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/calculus-indexed.pdf)).
