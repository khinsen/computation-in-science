This is the companion Web site to my book "[Computation in Science](https://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-1-6817-4093-5)", published in December 2015 in the "[Concise Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/books/iop-concise-physics)" series of [IOP Publishing](http://ioppublishing.org/). It contains additional notes for each chapter, in particular with references to on-line material that I consider of interest for my readers.

I will regularly add new references that I discover and remove links that no longer work. Suggestions and corrections are welcome - please [open an issue](https://github.com/khinsen/computation-in-science/issues) (or submit a pull request) on the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/khinsen/computation-in-science).
